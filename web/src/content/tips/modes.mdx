# Modes

Codebuff has four modes that control how it handles your requests. Switch modes using command-line flags or cycle through them with `Ctrl+M` in the CLI.

## Default

The standard mode. Uses Claude Opus 4.5 with a balanced workflow:

- Spawns file pickers and code searchers to gather context
- Uses the `editor` agent for code changes
- Spawns `thinker` for complex problems
- Runs code review after changes
- Validates with typechecks and tests

```bash
codebuff  # no flag needed
```

## Lite (`--lite`)

Faster and cheaper. Uses Grok 4.1 Fast with a streamlined workflow:

- Reduced file context gathering
- Uses `editor-gpt-5` for code changes
- Skips code review
- No todo tracking or followup suggestions

Best for quick fixes, simple questions, and when you want faster responses.

```bash
codebuff --lite
```

## Max (`--max`)

Maximum quality. Uses Claude Opus 4.5 with enhanced workflows:

- Reads 12-20+ files per task for deeper context
- Uses `editor-multi-prompt` which generates multiple implementation proposals and picks the best
- Spawns `thinker-best-of-n-opus` for complex problems (multiple reasoning paths)
- Full code review after changes
- Validates both specific changes and the full project

Best for complex features, refactoring, and when correctness matters more than speed.

```bash
codebuff --max
```

## Plan (`--plan`)

Spec-writing mode. Does not modify files.

- Gathers context about your codebase
- Asks clarifying questions using `ask_user`
- Outputs a spec/plan wrapped in `<PLAN>` tags
- Includes requirements, constraints, and relevant files

Use this to scope out work before implementing, or to discuss approaches without making changes.

```bash
codebuff --plan
```

## Switching Modes

**At startup:**
```bash
codebuff --lite
codebuff --max
codebuff --plan
```

**During a session:**
Press `Ctrl+M` to cycle through modes, or use the mode toggle in the input area.
